	version 1.2 new features:
	* Generate EVM signatures based on the specified hash algorithm
	* include "security.apparmor" in EVM signature
	* Add support for writing & verifying "user.xxxx" xattrs for testing
	* Support Strebog/Gost hash functions
	* Add OpenSSL engine support
	* Use of EVP_PKEY OpenSSL API to generate/verify v2 signatures
	* Support verifying multiple signatures at once
	* Support new template "buf" field and warn about other unknown fields
	* Improve OpenSSL error reporting
	* Support reading TPM 2.0 PCRs using tsspcrread

	Bug fixes and code cleanup:
	* Update manpage stylesheet detection
	* Fix xattr.h include file
	* On error when reading TPM PCRs, don't log gargabe
	* Properly return keyid string to calc_keyid_v1/v2 callers, caused by
	  limiting keyid output to verbose mode
	* Fix hash buffer overflow caused by EVM support for larger hashes,
	  defined MAX_DIGEST_SIZE and MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE, and added "asserts".
	* Linked with libcrypto instead of OpenSSL
	* Updated Autotools, replacing INCLUDES with AM_CPPFLAGS
	* Include new "hash-info.gen" in tar
	* Log the hash algorithm, not just the hash value
	* Fixed memory leaks in: EV_MD_CTX, init_public_keys
	* Fixed other warnings/bugs discovered by clang, coverity
	* Remove indirect calls in verify_hash() to improve code readability
	* Don't fallback to using sha1
	* Namespace some too generic object names
	* Make functions/arrays static if possible

	version 1.1
	* Support the new openssl 1.1 api
	* Support for validating multiple pcrs
	* Verify the measurement list signature based on the list digest
	* Verify the "ima-sig" measurement list using multiple keys
	* Fixed parsing the measurement template data field length
	* Portable & immutable EVM signatures (new format)
	* Multiple fixes that have been lingering in the next branch. Some
	  are for experimental features that are not yet supported in the
	  kernel.
